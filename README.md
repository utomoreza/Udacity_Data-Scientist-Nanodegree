# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

This repository contains my projects for [Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

## Project 1: Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post 
For this project, I explore data science survey by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/overview). By using such data, I'd like to answer some questions asking by anyone who aspires to dive in to the field or who has been in the field.<br>

## Project 2: Disaster Response Pipeline Project
In this project, you'll find a web app where you can input a new message and get classification results in several categories.<br>

## Capstone Project: Starbucks Challenge
This is a capstone project. I used datasets provided by Starbucks. I implemented several models to predict how much money customers spent on Starbucks products.<br>
