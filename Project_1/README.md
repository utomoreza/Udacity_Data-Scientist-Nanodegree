# How Much Do You Know to Enter Data ScienceÂ Field?

## Dependencies
To run the notebook, you are recommended to install the following packages.
- python ver > 3.6
- numpy (works at any version)
- pandas (works at any version)
- seaborn (works at any version)
- matplotlib (works at any version)

- jupyter_contrib_nbextensions (recommended but not compulsory)
 
No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Project Motivation
Since a couple of years ago, Data Science's hype has been increasing. Many are trying to enter the field, no matter men or women. However, as the field is one of technology fields in which usually men dominate the workforce, if you are a female, do you have a chance or similar opportunities in driving into data science field?

In addition, as the field has various roles, e.g. Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning (ML) Engineer, etc., don't you think what skills required to become one of them? Or even if you were to master most skills needed for all of the four, will you earn more?

Therefore, in this Project, we're interested to answer the following questions:
- How promising data field for women compared to men?
- What are skills needed to become a data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, or ML engineer?
- By becoming a Full Stack Data Professional, do you earn more?

For this project, I explore data science survey by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/overview). By using such data, I'd like to answer some questions asking by anyone who aspires to dive in to the field or who has been in the field.

## Description of Files
The main file is `Project1.ipynb` notebook. The `question.txt` file lists all questions I'd like to answer in the near future. The `datasets` directory contains all datasets, even Kaggle surveys from before 2020. The `assets` directory consists of files needed for visualization in the notebook.

## Findings
The main story of this repo can be found on my Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@stephanieirvine15/how-data-will-make-you-drink-wine-differently-c59d669831a1). But, for the more elaborate findings, you could read the notebook.
